# Correct-code

### The code had a minor issue related to the initial value in the reduce() method. Since the accumulator is not explicitly initialized, it will take the first element of the numbers array as the initial value. This might lead to unexpected behavior.
### To fix this issue and correctly separate even and odd numbers into their respective arrays, you should provide an initial accumulator value with evens and odds properties as empty arrays.
